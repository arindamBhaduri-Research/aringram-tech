# Python for ML: My Thoughts as a Learner (and Resources to Get You Started)
Are you thinking about getting into Machine Learning? Here’s one word you’ll hear constantly: Python. As you might know, it is a computer language. It was created by Guido van Rossum. His main aim was to create a high-level language that is extremely easy to read even for non-coders. He achieved his goals, since in my opinion, Python is the easiest language to both read and learn. 

## Why Learn Python?

Should you start your machine learning journey with python? The immediate answer would be a resounding ‘YES!’. Almost all of the machine learning and AI code is written using Python. Some of the most commonly used data science and machine learning libraries, like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow and Pytorch are used using Python. While Python may not be computationally efficient, it can be written very fast, making it efficient for faster development cycles in ML projects. It is also easy to learn, can be used across various OS and has a large and active community for support, documentation and readily available solutions to problems.  

### It's that Straightforward?

Well, there is another aspect to learning Python that I want to explore. It is the development of ‘computational logic’. A writer needs to be imaginative, a mathematician needs to develop a certain logic. Similarly, a computer scientist needs to develop a computational logic that helps them to code. If you are learning about ML out of curiosity, or just to help you with your career, go ahead and start your journey with Python. However, if you are a computer science student and wish to one day create AI software, there is an additional task. 

In my opinion, Python provides ready-made functions for a lot of basic operations and functionalities. This prevents one from knowing what exactly is happening under the hood. You can learn to code in Python, and write excellent code at that, but you will face difficulties when you try to understand what exactly that piece of code is doing inside the system. Can you get by without this understanding? Yes. But if you want to go all the way, I recommend first learning a language that allows you to work with the system at a lower level. There are many good options like C, C++ or Java. I personally recommend C++. It offers both mid-level and high-level functionality and has object-oriented programming features. But most importantly, C++ is the language in which most of Python’s data science and machine learning libraries are written in. This is because C++ is must faster to compile and execute as compared to Python. So in the future, if you ever need to work with or develop Python libraries, this knowledge of C++ will come in handy.

## Python Why? Tick. But Python Where?

If you wish to learn Python, you gotta start somewhere, right? Here are two learning sources that I personally used:
1. freeCodeCamp: Go to their 'archived courses' section and look for the course '[Scientific Computing with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)'. Or, you can also check out their video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc (although I prefer the former).
2. Python Official Documentation: A great way to look up and learn about specific concepts is to read the official documentation at: python.org/doc/ 
Here are some other highly recommended sources that you could check out:
	1. [Coursera - Python for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
	2. [Python Tutorials by Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU)
	3. [Real Python Tutorials](https://realpython.com/)

### Practice Makes Perfect

In Python, first start by understanding all the basic data types, variable declarations, conditional statements and looping logic. You can build simple applications like:
1. number Guessing Game,
2. simple calculator,
3. Even/odd number checker,
4. fibonacci sequence generator,
5. multiplication table generator,
6. palindrome checker,
7. rock, paper, scissors game, etc.

Then learn about the different data types in python: sets, lists, tuples and dictionaries. Here are some mini project ideas that you can implement to practice your coding skills:
1. student grade book system
2. simple inventory management system
3. shopping cart
4. to-do list application
5. word frequency counter
6. email validator,
7. tic-tac-toe game, etc.

## Conclusion (finally!)

By this time, you will have learnt all the basics of the Python programming language. Continue to learn some more advanced concepts as per your interest, and also practice your coding skills. I recommend LeetCode and Hackerrank. You don'y need to become a pro. Just get used to the act of coding a program. And once you think you are ready, move ahead and tackle the next challenge on your machine learning journey: Data Science!
