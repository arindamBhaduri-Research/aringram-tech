## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up the project environment.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourOrganization/YourProjectName.git
    cd YourProjectName
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:** (Recommend using Conda or venv)
    *   Using Conda:
        ```bash
        conda env create -f environment.yml # If you provide an environment.yml
        conda activate your_env_name
        ```
    *   Using venv:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
        ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Data Setup:** (If applicable)
    Explain where to get the data and where to place it (e.g., "Download data from [link] and place it in the `data/raw/` directory").

## Usage

Explain how to run your code or notebooks.

*   **Running Scripts:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/your_script.py --argument value
    ```
*   **Using Notebooks:**
    Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the desired `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Lab or Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    Explain the purpose of key notebooks (e.g., `01_data_exploration.ipynb`, `02_model_training.ipynb`).

## Project Structure
